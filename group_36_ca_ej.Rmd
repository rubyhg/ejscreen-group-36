```{r}
ces <- read_csv(here("data","ces3demographics.csv")) %>%

```{r}
ggplot(data = ces, aes(x = white_percent, y = ces_3_0_score)) +

```
The CES 3.0 score decreases as the percentage of the white demographic incerases. When the population is at least 75% white, there is a higher amount of aggregated observations, with a CES 3.0 score of 25 or less.
